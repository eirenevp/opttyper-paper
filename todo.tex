PhD award April 1; TYR April 6; OOPSLA deadline May 15, 23 pages excluding bibliography


Priorities:
Upload version of paper to Arxiv by April 1:
LambdaNet: describe what it does, and why we are doing something different.
Plan an experiment of running LambdaNet on our problem - describe this as future work.
Tidy the theoretical development.  The appendix ought to be readable as a self-contained document.
If you can do those things, then let's put this on Arxiv, ahead of April 1.
Circulate to Earl and Charles by Friday 27th, ideally.  Put on Arxiv early next week, and at same time send to Gordon.
